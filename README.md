  May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects.
</p>


## Key concepts:
<ul>
  In this project, we must implement a function capable of reading one line from a file descriptor.
In that simple idea, we must manage multiple file descriptors and dynamic memory efficiently.
For that, we must learn about static variables and file handling in C.
</ul>

## Programming concepts:
<ul>
<li>Memory Manipulation</li>
<li>File Handling</li>
<li>Static Variables</li>
  </ul>

## Technologies:
<ul>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>GIT</li>
  <li>Makefile</li>
  <li>Standard Lib C</li>
</ul>

## Skills:
<ul>
  <li>Unix</li>
  <li>algorihms & AI</li>
  <li>Rigor</li>
  <li>File Descriptors</li>
  <li>Static variables</li>
</ul>

## Soft skills:
<ul>
 This next batch of projects requires some time management, and adapting to some fixed time limits that must be respected and shared between more projects.
In that sense, we nee to adequately manage time and learning.
    This project require learning new technical concepts that can be challenging at this level. For that, we must rely on in other students and our ability to search for valid information without getting lost into excessive content.
